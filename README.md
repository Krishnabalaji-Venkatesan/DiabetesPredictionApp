# Diabetes Risk Prediction System Using Random Forest

## Project Overview

This project presents a Machine Learning based web application developed to predict diabetes risk using medical diagnostic parameters. The system uses the Random Forest Classifier algorithm and is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

The application allows users to input health parameters and receive an instant prediction along with a probability score.

## Objective

- To develop a predictive model for diabetes risk classification.
- To implement the model using Random Forest algorithm.
- To deploy the model as an interactive web application.
- To provide clear visualization of input health parameters.
